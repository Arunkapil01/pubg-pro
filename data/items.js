The First Aid Kit is best used for times where immediate healing is needed, otherwise bandages should be used first. First aid kits restore significantly more health than bandages, but will still take 6 seconds to cast, therefore this item should be used with caution while under fire. Boosters used before gunfights and coupled with bandages during battles can help reduce the reliance on first aid kits to restore health.\n\n*First Aid Kits heal a character's health to 75 instantly.This item cannot be used when a player's health is over 75.*",

  "bandage":{
   "name":"Bandage",
    "sum":"The bandage is a common item that takes 4 seconds to cast, restoring health by 10 over 4 seconds. Bandages are the most common medical item in Battlegrounds, healing much slower than a First Aid Kit and taking longer to use. Unlike the other instant healing consumables however, bandages can be used in moving vehicles allowing health recovery on the move, although rough terrain will often cancel the usage animation. Since bandages heal a smaller amount of health than First Aid Kits, they should be used when minor healing is required. However, as with the First Aid Kit, bandages cannot heal past 75 health, requiring boosters to restore the remaining 25 health.",
