Dealing the highest amount of damage out of any gun in the game, it is also one of only two ranged weapons (the other being the crossbow) capable of killing any player in one shot to the head, even if the victim is wearing a Spetsnaz helmet. At distances beyond 500 meters, it becomes the only gun in the game that can kill players in one shot to the head. The long reload, time between shots, high damage and unique ammo all represent the high risk, high reward gameplay that requires the user to have patience and a steady aim, moving position quickly after firing, lest other players recognizing the firing sound of the AWM attempt to close in to take the weapon for themselves.\nThe AWM will deal maximum damage out to 150 meters, with maximum damage falloff at 679 meters."

Thus, this rifle excels in medium-range combat and packs devastating stopping power if a user can handle this gun effectively in CQC (close-quarter combat), but will be less effective in long- to extreme-combat as it lacks the precision of dedicated sniper rifles. Players who wish to use a weapon with high damage, rate of fire and long range effectiveness should look for the SKS, as it is one of the few weapons with such properties.This gun also has the benefit of accepting the most attachments out of all the sniper rifles. The SKS shown and used in PUBG is a Chinese F.D.E. version made by Tapco.\nThe SKS is not without its downsides however. Its standard capacity magazine of only 10 rounds, combined with high recoil and high precision compared to the automatic rifles require the user to stand still in order to land consistent shots, which in turn makes them an easy target. Use this to your advantage if you know your attacker is using one of these. Another thing to keep in mind would be counting shots in the magazine; if you hear the enemy shoot off 10 shots, you can use that time to change your position or advance on the shooter, although there is the risk that they have extended mags on the gun and may simply be waiting for you to expose yourself.",

Other drawbacks are its inability to accept foregrips of any kind, or any telescopic sights stronger than a 6x scope, reinforcing its use as a close-quarters weapon. Backing this up is the fact that the only muzzle attachment it can take is a suppressor.\n\nThese flaws only serve to represent the power of the Groza, and it is therefore advised to prioritise players using this weapon, especially when there are less than 10 players alive.

With a vertical grip and compensator the rifle can comfortably be used on full auto even with a 4x scope. The most noticeable drawback is its restrictive iron sights, so finding a reflex sight or scope should be a priority when finding this weapon. It also has the slowest bullet speed of the 5.56mm rifles, although this is still much faster than the 7.62mm rifles. The slow bullet speed and relatively mediocre stats of this gun are compensated by the fact that this gun has the furthest minimum damage falloff distance of all the non-crate assault rifles and that gunfire from this weapon is quieter compared to the other assault rifles.\n\nThe SCAR-L will deal maximum damage out to 70 meters, reaching its minimum at 495 meters.",

      "The S1897 excels in clearing houses with the simple point-and-shoot principle, its spread allowing a greater probability of hitting the target. Careful aim is still essential since missing one shot can easily result in death due to the time required to rack the pump.\n\nWith a choke attached, the shotgun gains considerable range in the form of 25% tighter spread, being able to take out opponents from a fairly long distance. The reduced spread means reduced effectiveness in close quarters combat however. The duckbill choke has the opposite effect, spreading the pellets over a wider horizontal area, increasing effectiveness at close range.",
